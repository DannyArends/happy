Happy is an R package to help with the identification of genetic loci that
are associated with a disease. It is designed to be applied to genotyping
data of one generation, that are all derived from a limited number (~
8) of parents. Those conditions are found in lab grown animals, for which
the individuals are either inbred, to be then shared in the community,
or larger experiments which may decide to outbreed individuals from a small
founder generation.

To help the aims of the EU COST "SYSGENET", happy is now made available
as a github project. This will also help the development of happy, which
today is dispersed among its current and past contributors. All of them
will have github repositories themselves. For the moment, you
are asked to take a repository (probably a master branch) of your liking,
as the core functionality is shared among them all. Further instructions 
on where to download from will be published in due course on
