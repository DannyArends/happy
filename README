Happy is an R package to help with the identification of genetic loci that
are associated with a disease. It is designed to be applied to genotyping
data of one generation, that are all derived from a limited number (~
8) parents. Those conditions are found in lab grown animals, for which
the individuals are either inbred, to be then shared in the community,
or larger experiments may decide to outbread individuals from a small
founder generataion.

To help the aims of the EU COST "SYSGENET", happy is now made available
as a github project. This will also help the development of happy, which
today is dispersed among its current and past contributors. All of them
will have github repositories themselves. For the moment speaking, you
are asked to take a tree of your liking as the core functionality is
shared among them all. Further instructions on from where to download
will be published in due time on
